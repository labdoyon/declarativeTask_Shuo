ANY STEP OF THE EXPERIMENT THAT USES THE MATRIX (ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THEM)
WILL IMPORT THE MATRIX FROM THE LEARNING (PRELEARN, ses-ExpD1_task-Learn-1stClass)

IF THERE ARE SEVERAL PRELEARN FILES, THE PROGRAM USES THE LATEST ONE

All prelearn files will use the matrix generated in the first prelearn file
if you have prelearn run 02 03 04, they all used the matrix generated in run-01

If you want to generate a new matrix
You have to delete (or move to a different directory) all the previous prelearn files
